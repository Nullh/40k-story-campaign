# Battle for Masali
## Campaign Overview
Masali - a small, unassuming agri-world, one of three in the Masali system. This small world is a linchpin in providing food for the rest of Ultramar. Due to its secluded location and sparse population of indentured workers and servitors this planet is often left to manage itself, only visited when the grinding wheels of Ultramar's beurocracy require it.

It is this seclusion that has drawn the attention of the dark gods. Father Nurgle, the Lord of Decay has set his sights on the verdant plains of Masali. Spreading his foul seeds on this world allows Nurgle to spread his children throughout Ultramar bringing ruin and chaos to the hated Ultramarines.

The Masali system is protected by star fort Eucladus, it's powerful void fields protecting the vulnerable agri worlds from incursion through the immaterium. Eucladus is home to the Ultramarines 7th Reserve Company, led by Cief Victualler Nonus Ixion, master of the 7th. However, librarian Petronius Ullanus seconded to the 7th, has been unwittingly infected with the Cyclospora Septa. This spore, the latest gestation of the Destroyer Hive, will prove to be the crack needed to breach the armour of Masali, then Ultramar itself.
