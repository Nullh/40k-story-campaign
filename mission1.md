# Battle for Masali
## Mission 1 - Infiltration

### Background
The forces of Nurgle are trying to infiltrate the Masali system. To do this they must reach a command bunker on Star Fort Eucladus and disable its void shields, allowing the invasion to begin.

To allow them access to the fort, agents of the Death Guard have unknowingly infected librarian Petronius Ullanus with spores of the Cyclospora Septa. This has given the Death Guard control of the actions of the librarian, and a path into the Masali system...

### Setup
This mission is played on a 4x4 board.

The Chaos forces start with no models on the table. Librarian Ullanus is set up on the southern edge of the table, with the target bunker on the northern edge. Sentries (a generic troop unit) are set up randomly on the board as single models and act as [sentries](./sentries.md).

The target bunker is an Imperial Bunker with a mounted Quad Gun that can only target the nearest enemy unit within 12".

The Chaos player may have up to 7 models in their army. One representing each player, plus as many infantry models as they like. The Imperial player picks an army of similar points value, but all their choices will act as sentries.

## Victory
The Chaos player must embark one unit into the target bunker in order to disable the void shields and win the mission.
The Chaos player gains victory points equal to the Imperial players army cost in power.
## Special Rules
The Chaos player begins with no models on the board as their army is set up in the warp, however they have control of the librarian. At any time the Chaos player can choose to trigger the Cycolospora within the librarian, slaying the librarian immediately in a shower of blood and summoning the Chaos troops from the warp. All Chaos troops must then be deployed within 9" of the location of the librarian. This counts as their movement.

The librarian cannot advance due to the infestation ravaging his body. At the beginning of each turn roll a dice and add the current turn number. On a 6+ the librarian has succumbed to the cyclospora and explodes, summoning the Chaos troops as above.

If the librarian is within 9" of a sentry roll an initiative test. If the test fails the sentry sees the infection burning though the librarian and raises the alarm as normal. If it succeeds the alarm is not raised.
