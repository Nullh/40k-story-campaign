# Sentries
Sentries are models that are not aware they are in a combat situation. They are subject to the following rules:

## Activation
A sentry is ignorant of the presence of the enemy until it is activated. It will only perform random movement until it is activated. An active sentry will act according to the DM. At the end of their turn an active sentry activates D6 other sentries within 12".

## Random Movement
Sentries move half their movement speed (rounding up) in a random direction determined by a scatter die.

## Alarm
A sentry who finishes their turn within 9" of an enemy unit will raise the alarm, activating that sentry and D6 sentries within 12". These newly activated sentries do not get to activate more sentries.
